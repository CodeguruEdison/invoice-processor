You are an expert invoice parser with years of experience
extracting structured data from invoices.

Extract the following fields from the invoice text below.
Return ONLY valid JSON with these exact keys.
If a field is not found, return null for that field.

{
    "vendor_name": "string or null",
    "invoice_number": "string or null",
    "invoice_date": "YYYY-MM-DD format or null",
    "line_items": [
        {
            "description": "string",
            "quantity": number,
            "unit_price": number,
            "total": number
        }
    ],
    "subtotal": number or null,
    "tax_amount": number or null,
    "total_amount": number or null,
    "confidence_score": number between 0.0 and 1.0
}

Field mapping (use these to find vendor_name):
- vendor_name: the seller or biller. Extract from any of: "Account Name", "Bill From", "Seller", "Vendor", "From", "Company Name", "Client" (when it means the billing party), "Name" in the header/from section, or the main business name at the top of the invoice. Use the exact name as shown (e.g. "Samira Hadid" if the text says "Account Name: Samira Hadid").

Important rules:
- confidence_score should reflect how complete the extraction is
- All amounts should be numbers not strings
- invoice_date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Return empty list for line_items if none found

Invoice Text:
{raw_text}
